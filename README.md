# TriteHexagon's ASM Repository

Here you can find all my Pok√©mon songs to use in your own hacks. Some of the songs utilize custom code so please follow the instructions here to get them working, or contact me so I can help.

## Normal

You can use these songs right away in your hack. Yay!

## Wavetype

## noisesampleset

[Tutorial](https://github.com/TriteHexagon/Trite_ASM_Repository/wiki/Add-a-new-music-command-to-change-drumkits)

## noisesampleset + wavetype

You need both modifications mentioned above to play these songs.

## night versions

You can follow [this tutorial](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki/Add-more-music-that-changes-at-night) for instructions on how to add the night versions of all Gen 2 overworld songs to your game. You need to replace the original music file for the corresponding song with the files in this repo; the night version reuses code from the original song and can be found at the bottom of the file. The Viridian City theme uses a special wave for the wave channel and will not sound good if you don't follow the tutorial.

## special_drumkit_3

These use a special version of drumkit #3 (found in the ```drumkits.asm``` file). You can replace your ```Drumkit3:``` with the one in this file or just replace the entire file. Eventually I'll change these songs to use the noisesampleset code instead (it's more elegant).
