# TriteHexagon's ASM Repository

Here you can find all my Pok√©mon songs to use in your own hacks. Some of the songs utilize custom code so please follow the instructions here to get them working, or contact me.

## Normal

You can use these songs right away in your hack. Yay!

## Wavetype

Tutorial coming soon!

## noisesampleset

Tutorial coming soon!

## noisesampleset + wavetype

You need both modifications mentioned above to play these songs.

## night versions

You need to replace the original music file for the corresponding song with this file; the night version reuses code from the original song and can be found at the bottom of the file. These songs use custom drumkits that are more quiet than the standard drumkits. Replace your ```drumkits.asm``` file with the one in this repo.

## special_drumkit_3

These use a special version of drumkit #3 (found in the ```drumkits.asm``` file). You can replace your ```Drumkit3:``` with the one in this file or just replace the entire file. Eventually I'll change these songs to use the noisesampleset code instead (it's more elegant).
